## Team Name: Tech Nova


## Team Members:
Team Lead: Ajina Joseph - Muthoot Institute of Technology and Science

## Project Description
This website accepts your resume and provides useful feedback for you to build upon. 
The feedback includes a summary of your set of skills, years of experience, and suggested improvements.

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Many don't have a clue if their resume is good or not.
Neither do they know how to improve upon their sub-par design.

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Luckily, we have a solution~
Our website will let you know what you're missing in your skillset, and what all you could simply add in to make it seem like you've actually accomplished anything ;)

In the video, we chose 3 resume files to upload. The website accepts those and sends feedback, including skillset, years of experience, and suggested possible changes to make. After analyzing one, we can choose to upload another file to analyze.
